# Observation loader: reads `data/observations.toml` and assembles
# the parsed counts, date offsets and citation strings into a
# `NamedTuple` consumed by the analysis pipeline.

"""
Load the observation block from `data/observations.toml` and return
it as a `NamedTuple`. Each observation in the TOML is a subtable
with `value = …` and `source = "…"`; this function returns both the
parsed numeric values and a parallel `sources::NamedTuple` of
citation strings so they can be printed alongside the data.

Fields returned:

- `exported_cases::Int`
- `exports_deaths::Int`
- `total_deaths::Int`
- `reported_cases::Int` — DRC suspected cumulative case count.
- `confirmed_cases::Union{Int, Missing}` — DRC laboratory-confirmed
  cumulative case count, the truth-anchor on the latent
  eventually-confirmable pool ``C(T)`` (reported counts are an inflated
  view); `missing` when no `confirmed_cases` block is present.
- `reported_case_history::Union{NamedTuple, Missing}` — vintage-by-vintage
  cumulative DRC suspected counts, with fields `dates`, `offsets` (days
  before `as_of_date`, sorted ascending) and `values` (cumulative count
  at each sitrep date). Drives the daily reported-cases likelihood by
  per-day differencing. `missing` when no `reported_case_history` block
  is present.
- `confirmed_case_history::Union{NamedTuple, Missing}` — same layout for
  cumulative DRC laboratory-confirmed counts. Drives the daily
  confirmed-cases likelihood. `missing` when absent.
- `death_history::Union{NamedTuple, Missing}` — same layout for
  cumulative DRC suspected deaths. Drives the daily deaths likelihood.
  `missing` when absent.
- `cumulative_tests_analysed::Union{Int, Missing}` — cumulative number
  of suspected-case specimens whose lab processing has completed by the
  cut-off. Paired with `confirmed_cases` it gives a per-test positivity
  observation; right-truncation is handled inside the model by the lab
  delay CDF. `missing` when no `cumulative_tests_analysed` block is
  present.
- `cumulative_tests_analysed_offset::Int` — elapsed time (days before
  `as_of_date`) at which the testing volume was observed, from an
  optional `date` under the `cumulative_tests_analysed` block; `0` when
  absent (observed at the cut-off). Lets the lab volume lag the case
  cut-off without being silently re-dated.
- `daily_outbound_travellers::Real`
- `daily_outbound_travellers_sd::Real`
- `source_population::Int`
- `genetic_tmrca_days::Union{Real, Missing}` — estimated time to the
  most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in days before `as_of_date`, a
  soft lower bound on the seeding time `T`; `missing` when no
  `genetic_tmrca` block is present.
- `genetic_tmrca_days_sd::Union{Real, Missing}` — SD (days) on the
  location of that floor; `missing` when absent.
- `genetic_tmrca_alt_days::Union{Real, Missing}` — TMRCA (days before
  `as_of_date`) under the alternative clock rate, for the clock-rate
  sensitivity; `missing` when no `alt_date` is present.
- `genetic_tmrca_alt_days_sd::Union{Real, Missing}` — SD (days) on the
  alternative-clock floor; `missing` when absent.
- `sources::NamedTuple` — citation per loaded field, with the same keys
  as the numeric fields above. Optional fields (`confirmed_cases`,
  `genetic_tmrca`) carry `missing` rather than a citation when absent.
