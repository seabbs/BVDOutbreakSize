"""
Joint composer over all data streams. Conditions on exports, the DRC
suspected-deaths, reported (suspected) and laboratory-confirmed case
streams, the dated deaths-among-exports series, and optional
export-detection timing and genetic seeding bound.

The DRC deaths, reported and confirmed streams are fitted per
sitrep vintage: `total_deaths`, `reported_cases` and `confirmed_cases`
are cumulative-count vectors (index 1 = oldest) and the model fits the
between-vintage increments. Each carries its own offsets vector
(`death_offsets`, `reported_offsets`, `confirmed_offsets`; days before
the cut-off), converted to elapsed times `T - offset` internally so the
bin edges track the latent `T`. A length-1 vector with offset `0`
reduces a stream to its cumulative single-total likelihood, recovering
the McCabe et al. Method 2 configuration. Pass a vector of `missing`
entries (with matching offsets) to drop a stream while keeping the model
usable as a prior- and posterior-predictive generator.

DRC ascertainment is a per-bin random effect drawn from the pooled
hyperprior via [`daily_ascertainment_model`](@ref): each case bin sees
its own `p_drc_t = logistic(μ_logit + τ_logit · z_drc_t)`. Reported and
confirmed bins for the same vintage share their draw (the BVD pool is
shared between the two streams). With a single bin the random effect is
one draw from the same population as the pooled scalar `p_drc`.

`tests_analysed` is a single cumulative testing-volume count observed at
its own elapsed time `tests_offset` before the cut-off, so it stays
robust if lab reporting lags or stops before the case cut-off. Per-test
positivity is exposed as a derived quantity rather than re-observing the
confirmed counts conditional on tests. Pass `tests_analysed = missing`
to drop it.

`deaths_ascertainment` samples a multiplicative drift factor `p_deaths`
on the expected-deaths trajectory (see
[`deaths_ascertainment_model`](@ref)); pass `p_deaths_fixed = 1.0` to
disable the factor entirely.
