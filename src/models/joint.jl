# Joint composer models: build the full generative model for each
# analysis by running the generating infection process once, staging it to
# daily onset incidence, and routing the shared onsets into the relevant
# observation submodels. Single-stream composers condition on one stream
# each; [`bvd_joint`](@ref) conditions on all streams plus the optional
# genetic seeding bound. Any count passed as `missing` is dropped, so the
# composers double as prior- and posterior-predictive generators.
#
# Submodels whose `:=` deterministics are re-exposed at composer level are
# attached with a prefixed `to_submodel(x)` (no `false`); attaching them
# with `to_submodel(x, false)` would re-introduce the nested `:=` names at
# the parent and trip Turing's MustNotOverwriteError on the duplicates.

## Run the generating infection process and onset staging, returning the
## infection state and the daily onsets shared by every stream.

"""
Joint composer over all data streams. Runs the generating infection
process once on a daily grid of length `n` (day `n` is the cut-off),
stages it to daily onset incidence, then conditions on the DRC suspected
cases, deaths and confirmed cases (each as a per-vintage time series), the
Uganda exports and deaths-among-exports, and the optional genetic seeding
bound on the outbreak age. Each stream argument may be `missing` to drop
it, so the model doubles as a prior- and posterior-predictive generator.

`breakpoint` is the intervention day passed to the reproduction-number
walk (e.g. the first WHO situation report); `genetic` injects the genetic
seeding submodel when `tmrca_days` is given. Tracked deterministics:
`C_T` (cumulative infections by the cut-off), `r` and `doubling_time`
(current growth), `r0` (implied initial growth), `T` (outbreak age),
`R_T` (current reproduction number) and the per-stream expected counts.
