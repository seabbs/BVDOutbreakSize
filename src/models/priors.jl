# Prior and latent-state submodels: the building blocks shared across the
# observation submodels and the joint composer. Each `@model` is one piece
# of the generative process — a single prior, a delay, the reproduction
# number, the generating infection process, or the onset staging — so it
# can be reused across composers without duplication. Delays are sampled
# from priors and discretised with CensoredDistributions; nothing is fixed.

"""
Generic delay submodel parameterised by mean and SD, discretised to a
daily PMF over lags `0 … nmax` by double interval censoring of a
moment-matched LogNormal (see [`lognormal_meansd`](@ref) and
[`discretise_censored`](@ref)). The LogNormal CDF differentiates cleanly
under Mooncake, so this is the AD-safe discretisation route for every
delay in the renewal convolutions. The mean and SD carry
weakly-informative priors, so the delay is estimated rather than fixed.
Returns `(; pmf, dist, mean, sd)`.

Generation-interval submodel. The mean and SD are sampled from priors

"""
Weekly piecewise-linear log-scale reproduction number over `n` days, with
a smooth intervention ramp. Knots sit at weekly spacing
([`knot_days`](@ref)) and follow a Gaussian random walk in non-centred
cumulative-sum form: standard-normal innovations are scaled by `sigma_rw`
and accumulated, avoiding the funnel geometry of the centred recursion and
matching the non-centred ascertainment block. Daily log-`R_t` is the
linear interpolation between knots ([`interpolate_knots`](@ref)). An
intervention at `breakpoint` (e.g. the first WHO situation report) adds a
sampled effect `intervention_effect` shaped by a logistic ramp
([`sigmoid_ramp`](@ref)), so transmission changes gradually over `ramp`
days rather than instantly; `breakpoint = missing` drops the term.

"""
Seed submodel: the latent infection count `I0` on the last day of the

Generating infection process: the latent submodel whose expected daily
infections every downstream stream consumes. Samples the reproduction
number trajectory, the generation interval and the seed via injected
submodels, derives the seeding-window growth rate from the initial
reproduction number through the Euler–Lotka relation
([`euler_lotka_r`](@ref)), seeds the first `length(g)` days as exponential
growth ([`seed_infections`](@ref)), then runs the discrete renewal
recursion ([`renewal_infections`](@ref)). Replaces the integral model's
exponential-growth trajectory. The `breakpoint` is forwarded to the
reproduction-number submodel so the intervention ramp lands on the right
day. Exposes the daily infection incidence, its cumulative sum, and the
reported growth summaries: the current growth rate `r` and
