Prior on the cumulative case count `C(T) = exp(r·T)` via a doublings
parameterisation. Samples the exponential growth rate `r` and a
doubling-count `m = T/τ`, then exposes `(τ, m, r, T, C_T, cumulative)`
as deterministics for downstream submodels.

McCabe et al.'s primary assumption is the doubling time (their 7/14/21-day
sweep); each doubling time implies a growth rate `r = log(2)/τ`, and the
prior is placed on that implied `r` rather than on `τ`, which is recovered
as the deterministic `τ = log(2)/r`. The default
`r ~ LogNormal(log(log(2)/14), 0.4)` is exactly equivalent to the previous
`τ ~ LogNormal(log(14), 0.4)`: because `r = log(2)/τ` is a reciprocal, the
log-scale SD `0.4` is preserved, so the implied doubling-time prior (and
hence every derived quantity) is unchanged. Only the sampled coordinate
differs.

The doubling-count prior `m ~ Normal(9, 2.5)` (truncated at 0) is centred
on `m = 9` (`C_T = 2^9 = 512`), matching McCabe et al.'s central
back-calculation scenario (a 14-day doubling time gives `m = log2(C_T)`
of ≈ 9.1–9.8 across their CFR band), with the SD 2.5 still bracketing
their full headline range on the log scale.
