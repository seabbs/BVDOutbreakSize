Laboratory pipeline likelihood. Models the lab-confirmed cases over time

`confirmed_cases` (`Cumul positifs`) is a per-vintage vector aligned with

as independent NegBinomial terms with per-bin mean

where `μ_BVD,0` is the unit-ascertainment onset-to-report BVD cumulative

`s_test` is the PCR sensitivity. A [`DailyBVDTrajectory`](@ref)
precomputes `μ_BVD,0` once on a shared Gauss-Legendre node set so the
outer quadrature of the lab convolution is reused across every edge.

`tests_analysed` (`Cumul échantillons analysés`) is a single cumulative
count observed at its own elapsed time `tests_edge` (which may lag the
case cut-off `T` if lab reporting stops earlier). When present it enters
as one NegBinomial term with mean
``\\tau\\,(\\text{BVD}_\\text{tested} + \\text{bg}_\\text{tested})``
accumulated to `tests_edge`; the background tested volume uses the
lab-delay CDF ``F_\\text{lab}`` (via `_gamma_cdf`, finite α gradient
under Mooncake, see #138) so right-truncation is handled by the
integration limits. The per-test positivity
`s · BVD_tested / (BVD_tested + bg_tested)` is exposed as a derived
quantity for comparison with the sitrep figure; confirmed counts are not
re-observed conditional on tests, so the two streams are not
double-counted. Pass `tests_analysed = missing` to drop the testing
stream.
