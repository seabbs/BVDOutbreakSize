observed increment for vintage `i` is `counts[i] - counts[i-1]` (the first

- Confirmed cases. The BVD onset-to-report daily series (the unit

  report-to-confirmation (lab-turnaround) delay, then scaled by the DRC
  ascertainment `p_drc`, the PCR sensitivity `s_test` and the testing
  fraction `τ_test`. The modelled cumulative confirmed cases are read off
  at each `confirmed_history` vintage day and the increments fitted with a
  NegativeBinomial sharing `k`. The cut-off total is fitted likewise.
- Tests analysed. The tested daily volume is `τ_test` times the sum of the
  `p_drc`-scaled BVD lab series and the non-BVD background `λ_bg` carried
  through the same lab delay. Its cumulative is read off at the
  `lab_history` vintage days (so a lab stream that lags the case cut-off is
  right-truncated by reading the running cumulative at its own days) and
  the increments fitted with a NegativeBinomial sharing `k`. Confirmed
  counts are not re-observed conditional on the tested volume, so the two
  lab streams are not double-counted.

Samples the lab-turnaround delay and the PCR sensitivity via injected
submodels; the testing fraction `τ_test` and background rate `λ_bg` come
from [`reported_cases_model`](@ref) so the suspected and laboratory
