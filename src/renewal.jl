discrete analogue of the continuous onset-to-event densities used by the
integral model, and is the discretisation route the renewal convolutions
rely on. For a LogNormal primary the CDF differentiates cleanly under
Mooncake, so this is AD-safe; extreme warmup proposals that drive the
quadrature to a non-finite or zero total fall back to a uniform PMF so
