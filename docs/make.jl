# Copy the README to the home page, stripping the ABSTRACT marker
# comments. The analysis page reads them from the source README to load
# the abstract, but they must not appear on the rendered home page (the
# Vitepress typographer mangles the `--` and shows them as text).
#
# The README links to analysis-page sections with absolute hosted URLs
# so they work when read on GitHub. On the rendered home page those would
# pin to a fixed version (/dev/); rewrite them to Documenter `@ref`
# cross-references so they instead resolve within whichever version is
# being viewed. The link target is the section anchor, whose Documenter
# slug is the header title with spaces replaced by dashes, so reversing
# that recovers the title for `@ref`.
