Release notes for BVDOutbreakSize.
Major versions of the report are kept as
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/epiforecasts/BVDOutbreakSize/releases);
each push to `main` also republishes the rendered analysis and the
`output/` artifacts.

## v1.0.0

First release.
A joint Bayesian re-analysis of the McCabe et al. report that fits all
data streams together in a single Turing model over the latent
cumulative case count.

- Conditions on the exported cases and DRC deaths the report uses,
  plus reported DRC cases (with an ascertainment component) and deaths
  among exported cases.
- Adds a no-onward-transmission projected-deaths counterfactual, a
  one-week-ahead forecast of newly reported cases, deaths and exports,
  and an onset-to-death delay sensitivity analysis.
- Replaces the deaths-convolution and small-growth-rate exports
  closed-form approximations with their exact forms.
- Maths-first analysis page with code folded behind dropdowns and a
  diagram of the model build-up.
- Compares against a joint reimplementation of the report's approach
  and its original published estimates.
