#
# ## What we do differently from McCabe et al.
#
# - *Joint posterior, not 15 scenario estimates.* The reproduction
#   number trajectory, case-fatality ratio, all onset-to-event delays,
#   daily traveller volume and surveillance dispersion all have
#   priors and are sampled jointly. McCabe et al.
#   [mccabe2026](@cite) fix each and
#   sweep.
# - *Discrete renewal equation with a time-varying reproduction number.*
#   Daily infection incidence follows $I_t = R_t \sum_{s \ge 1} I_{t-s}
#   g_s$ where $g$ is the discretised generation-interval PMF. The
#   reproduction number $R_t$ follows a weekly Gaussian random walk on
#   the log scale with piecewise-linear within-week interpolation.
#   A logistic intervention ramp at the first WHO situation report adds a
#   sampled smooth step change. McCabe et al. use a single constant
#   exponential growth rate.
# - *Literature delays sampled from priors and discretised.* Every delay
#   — generation interval, incubation period, onset-to-death,
#   onset-to-report, onset-to-confirmation, onset-to-detection-abroad —
#   is sampled from a prior centred on published Ebola estimates and
#   discretised with double interval censoring (CensoredDistributions).
#   No delay is fixed.
# - *Euler–Lotka seeding.* The seeding window is filled with exponential
#   growth at the rate implied by the initial reproduction number and
#   generation interval via the Euler–Lotka relation, anchoring
#   infections smoothly at day 1 rather than placing a single seed.
# - *Discrete convolutions replace closed-form integrals.* Infections
#   are convolved to symptom onsets; every observation stream then
#   convolves the shared onsets with its own onset-to-event delay PMF.
#   This is exact (no large-$T$ or small-$rw$ approximation) and is
#   exact under the same onset incidence for all streams.
# - *Per-vintage time-series fitting.* The DRC streams (suspected cases,
#   confirmed cases, deaths) are fitted as cumulative time series of
#   between-vintage increments, conditioning on successive sitrep
#   updates. This sharpens the time-varying reproduction number. McCabe
#   et al. condition on a single cumulative total.
# - *Ascertainment extension* (not in McCabe et al.). Independent
#   per-stream priors on the reporting fractions give a joint posterior
#   over ascertainment alongside outbreak size.
# - *Cumulative quantities as derived outputs.* Cumulative infections
#   $C_T$ is the running sum of the renewal trajectory. Doubling time
#   and growth rate are derived from the day-over-day log-ratio at the
#   cut-off.
# - *Comparison against published scenarios.* Our joint posterior
#   $C_T$ is compared against all 15 published McCabe et al. scenario
#   estimates via a coverage table.
# - *No-onward-transmission counterfactual* (not in McCabe et al.).
#   Projects future expected deaths from infections already seeded by the
#   cut-off.
# - *Posterior-predictive forecasts* (not in McCabe et al.). A
#   one-week-ahead projection of each stream from the joint posterior.
#
# ## Limitations
#
# - *Fitted only to aggregate reported counts.* The data are a
#   handful of summary figures — total suspected cases in the DRC,
#   total suspected deaths in the DRC, and cases (and one death)
#   detected in Uganda — from press and situation reports. There is no
#   line list and no temporal information beyond the sitrep trajectory.
#   The model also has no knowledge of the situation on the ground (case
#   definitions, testing capacity, affected areas, reporting
#   completeness). Every estimate is a model-based extrapolation from
#   sparse summary statistics under strong assumptions rather than a
#   measurement.
# - *LLM-driven reimplementation.* The model code, priors,
#   convolution implementation and analysis were drafted by a
#   language model from the published McCabe et al.
#   [mccabe2026](@cite) report and the companion delay reanalysis,
#   then reviewed and revised. Not independently replicated against the
#   authors' code.
# - *Prior-driven inference where data is scarce.* The per-vintage
#   time-series provide some resolution on the reproduction number, but
#   a handful of sitrep totals give limited information about delay
#   parameters, surveillance dispersion, or the reporting fraction
#   individually. Posteriors for those parameters track their priors
#   closely.
# - *Inherits McCabe et al.'s epidemiological assumptions.* A single
#   zoonotic seed; the underlying case trajectory depends on an assumed
#   generation interval and epidemic structure; no spatial structure
#   beyond the Ituri / Nord Kivu split; no depletion of susceptibles.
# - *Intervention ramp is weakly identified.* The logistic ramp at the
#   first WHO situation report absorbs a change in transmission, but
#   with only a few sitreps straddling it, the ramp effect and the
#   pre-ramp reproduction number are not strongly separated.
# - *Per-sitrep increments are not clean new incidence.* Later sitreps
#   almost certainly backfill earlier cases and add newly-reporting
#   health zones; ascertainment likely rose over the window.
# - *Onset-to-death delay anchored on Isiro 2012.* Cross-outbreak
#   heterogeneity is unmodelled.
# - *Genetic seeding bound depends on a fixed clock rate.* The
#   molecular-clock TMRCA dates under an external literature rate; clock
#   uncertainty is not propagated here.
# - *Ascertainment weakly identified.* The DRC and Uganda ascertainment
#   fractions are sampled independently; the Uganda side is weakly
#   identified from a handful of suspected exports and tracks its prior.
# - *Observation streams share one case pool.* The streams are
#   modelled as conditionally independent given latent incidence, but
#   they observe overlapping individuals. Conditional independence
#   ignores this overlap, so it can understate uncertainty.
# - *Selection bias in deaths-among-exports.* If the system loses
#   cases that progress to death, the observed count is biased downward.
# - *Data conflict not explored in detail.* We have not systematically
#   checked whether the streams conflict — whether exports and deaths
#   streams imply different outbreak sizes.

# ## Methods
#
# ### Data
#
# The analysis uses a handful of aggregate counts. The DRC suspected
# cases, suspected deaths and laboratory-confirmed cases are the
# national cumulative totals from the INSP situation reports
# [insp_sitrep_2026](@cite), read from the report PDFs (archived by
# INRB-UMIE [inrb_umie_2026](@cite)). We draw straight from the sitreps
# rather than the published per-zone CSVs because the regional (health
# zone) breakdown is inconsistent with the national totals: the zone
# sums omit cases not yet attributed to a zone, understating the count.
# The Uganda export-case counts and deaths come from WHO Disease Outbreak
# News DON602 [who_don_2026_602](@cite); the cross-border traveller
# volume and source population from McCabe et al. [mccabe2026](@cite).
# The first table lists each figure as of the cut-off; the source
# population is fixed and the traveller volume is given a Normal prior
# around the McCabe et al. figure. The three DRC streams are
# additionally resolved by sitrep vintage and fitted as between-vintage
# increments, shown in the second table.

# ### Model
#
# #### Model overview
#
# We model a single outbreak seeded by a zoonotic introduction on a
# daily grid from a seeding date to the cut-off (day $n$). The
# generating infection process produces daily infection incidence via
# the discrete renewal equation
#
# ```math
# I_t = R_t \sum_{s = 1}^{L} I_{t-s}\, g_s, \tag{1}
# ```
#
# where $g$ is the discretised generation-interval PMF (indexed from
# lag 1, so an infectee is always infected strictly after its infector)
# and $R_t$ is the per-day reproduction number. We never observe
# infections directly: each available data stream observes a thinned,
# delayed or transformed view of the same latent incidence.
#
# The model is assembled from small reusable Turing [ge2018turing](@cite)
# submodels. Building-block submodels own the maths and priors for one
# parameter family. Observation submodels assemble those blocks,
# apply the convolution chain and the likelihood, and tie one stream to
# the latent incidence. Composers combine the observation submodels for
# the per-stream and joint fits.
#
# The table below shows which parameters feed each observation submodel:
#
# | Parameter | Exports | Deaths | Cases | Confirmed | Export deaths |
# |---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
# | Reproduction number $R_t$ | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
# | Generation interval | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
# | Incubation period | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
# | Onset-to-death delay |  | ● |  |  | ● |
# | Case-fatality ratio |  | ● |  |  | ● |
# | Onset-to-report delay |  |  | ● |  |  |
# | Onset-to-confirmation delay |  |  |  | ● |  |
# | Onset-to-detection delay | ● |  |  |  |  |
# | Surveillance dispersion |  | ● | ● | ● |  |
# | Ascertainment | ● |  | ● |  | ● |
# | Traveller volume | ● |  |  |  | ● |

# #### Building-block submodels
#
# The implementation uses Mooncake [mooncake_jl](@cite) reverse-mode
# automatic differentiation, CensoredDistributions for delay
# discretisation, FlexiChains for chain handling, and PairPlots
# [pairplots_jl](@cite) with AlgebraOfGraphics
# [danisch2021makie](@cite) for the figures.
#
# ##### Reproduction number — weekly random walk with intervention ramp
#
# Knots are placed at weekly intervals (day 1, 8, 15, …, $n$).
# The knot values follow a Gaussian random walk on the log scale in
# non-centred cumulative-sum form:
#
# ```math
# \log R_0 \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\log 1.3,\ 0.4), \qquad
# \sigma_{\text{rw}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(0,\ 0.2), \tag{2}
# ```
#
# ```math
# \log R_k = \log R_0 + \sigma_{\text{rw}}
#            \sum_{j=1}^{k} z_j, \quad
# z_j \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1). \tag{3}
# ```
#
# Daily $\log R_t$ is the piecewise-linear interpolation between knots.
# An intervention at the first WHO situation report adds a sampled
# effect shaped by a logistic ramp over seven days:
#
# ```math
# \log R_t \mathrel{+}= \delta \cdot
#     \mathrm{logistic}\!\left(\frac{t - t_{\text{bp}}}{7}\right),
# \qquad
# \delta \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0,\ 0.5). \tag{4}
# ```
#
# ##### Generation interval and incubation period
#
# The generation-interval PMF $g$ is sampled from a prior centred on
# the Ebola virus disease serial interval as a generation-time proxy
# (mean 15.3 d, SD 9.3 d; WHO Ebola Response Team 2014, NEJM), then
# discretised with double interval censoring
# (CensoredDistributions). The lag-0 bin is dropped and the remainder
# renormalised so an infectee is always strictly later than its
# infector:
#
# ```math
# \mu_g \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(15.3,\ 3.0), \qquad
# \sigma_g \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(9.3,\ 2.0). \tag{5}
# ```
#
# The incubation period is similarly discretised with a prior centred
# on the Ebola incubation (mean 9.7 d, SD 5.4 d; WHO Ebola Response
# Team 2014, NEJM):
#
# ```math
# \mu_{\text{inc}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(9.7,\ 2.0), \qquad
# \sigma_{\text{inc}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(5.4,\ 1.5). \tag{6}
# ```
#
# All LogNormal parameters are recovered by moment-matching from the
# sampled mean and SD.
#
# ##### Seeding — Euler–Lotka implied growth
#
# The seeding window (length $L$ = generation-interval support) is
# filled with exponential growth at the rate $r_0$ implied by the
# initial reproduction number $R_0 = R_t[1]$ and generation interval
# $g$ via the Euler–Lotka relation
#
# ```math
# R_0 \sum_{s=1}^{L} g_s \, e^{-r_0 s} = 1, \tag{7}
# ```
#
# solved by Newton iteration. The seed count on the last seeding day
# has a prior centred on a single introduction:
#
# ```math
# I_0 \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(1.0,\ 1.0). \tag{8}
# ```
#
# ##### Generating infection process and onset staging
#
# Infections $I_t$ are produced by equation (1) for $t > L$, with
# $I_{1:L}$ from the seeding window. Cumulative infections are the
# running sum $C_t = \sum_{s=1}^{t} I_s$; the cut-off cumulative is
# $C_T = C_n$. The renewal model's current growth rate $r$ and doubling
# time are derived from the day-over-day log-ratio at the cut-off:
#
# ```math
# r = \log I_n - \log I_{n-1}, \qquad
# \tau_{1/2} = \log(2) / r. \tag{9}
# ```
#
# Infections are convolved with the incubation PMF to produce daily
# symptom-onset incidence, which every downstream stream then consumes.
#
# ##### Onset-to-death delay
#
# The onset-to-death prior is centred on the Bayesian reanalysis of
# the Isiro 2012 BDBV line list
# [bdbv_linelist_analysis_2026](@cite) (mean 11.2 d, SD 5.4 d):
#
# ```math
# \mu_d \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(11.2,\ 2.0), \qquad
# \sigma_d \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(5.4,\ 1.5). \tag{10}
# ```
#
# ##### Case-fatality ratio
#
# The CDC summary for past BVD outbreaks is $55$ deaths in $169$ cases
# ($\approx 33\%$). The prior is
#
# ```math
# \mathrm{CFR} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(6.6,\ 13.4), \tag{11}
# ```
#
# with mean $0.33$ and 95% interval roughly $0.15$-$0.54$.

cfr_prior_fig = plot_cfr_prior(Beta(6.6, 13.4)); #hide
cfr_prior_fig #hide

# ##### Daily traveller volume
#
# The number of people crossing from the source area to Uganda each day
# sets the travel rate in the exports likelihood. McCabe et al. Table 3
# records a mean daily total of 1871 from the Ituri side. We use a
# truncated Normal prior centred on this figure:
#
# ```math
# N_{\text{travel}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(1871,\ 200). \tag{12}
# ```
#
# ##### Surveillance dispersion
#
# Passive-surveillance counts are modelled with negative-binomial
# observation error with a single shared dispersion $k$ for the DRC
# suspected deaths, reported cases and confirmed cases. Following Stan
# prior-choice recommendations [stan_prior_choice](@cite), the
# dispersion is sampled on the $1/\sqrt{k}$ scale:
#
# ```math
# 1/\sqrt{k} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(0.6,\ 0.2). \tag{13}
# ```
#
# ##### Ascertainment — independent per-stream fractions
#
# The DRC and Uganda ascertainment fractions $p_{\text{DRC}}$ and
# $p_{\text{Uganda}}$ are each sampled independently from a
# weakly-informative `Beta` prior:
#
# ```math
# p_{\text{DRC}} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(2,\ 6), \qquad
# p_{\text{Uganda}} \sim \mathrm{Beta}(2,\ 6). \tag{14}
# ```
#
# An earlier version coupled the two through a shared logit-scale
# hyperprior (partial pooling). With only a handful of Uganda exports and
# DRC totals to identify them, that hierarchy left a secondary
# small-outbreak mode in which a chain became trapped, so the fractions
# are now sampled independently to keep the joint fit mixing.
#
# ##### Genetic seeding bound
#
# A BEAST time tree of the first ten sequenced genomes
# [virological2026](@cite) places the TMRCA at a mean of
# 25 March 2026. We treat it as a right-censored, noisy reading of
# the seeding time, contributing $\Pr[\mathrm{Normal}(T, \sigma) \ge g]$
# where $g = t_{\text{cut}} - t_{\text{TMRCA}}$ and $\sigma = 15$ d.

# #### Observation submodels
#
# Each observation submodel takes the shared daily onset incidence,
# convolves it with a sampled onset-to-event delay PMF, scales by the
# relevant ascertainment, CFR or positivity factor, and reads the
# modelled cumulative count off the daily series at each vintage day.
# Likelihoods score the between-vintage increments.
#
# ##### Exports — geographic spread
#
# Each onset-day case travels to Uganda with daily rate
# $q = N_{\text{travel}} / N_{\text{pop}}$. The expected detected
# exports sum the onset-to-detection daily series:
#
# ```math
# \mu_e = p_{\text{Uganda}} \cdot q
#         \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{n} \mathrm{onsets}_t \cdot f_{\text{det}}(n - t),
# \qquad
# Y_{\text{exports}} \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\mu_e). \tag{16}
# ```
#
# The onset-to-detection delay is centred on the Ebola
# onset-to-hospitalisation delay (mean 5.0 d, SD 4.7 d; WHO Ebola
# Response Team 2014, NEJM):
#
# ```math
# \mu_{\text{det}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(5.0,\ 2.0), \qquad
# \sigma_{\text{det}} \sim \mathrm{Normal}^{+}(4.7,\ 1.5). \tag{17}
# ```
#
# ##### Deaths — back-calculation
#
# Expected cumulative deaths at the cut-off are the CFR-weighted
# discrete convolution of onsets with the onset-to-death PMF (equation
# (10)). The model conditions on the between-vintage increment at each
# sitrep date with a NegBinomial likelihood sharing $k$. The cut-off
# total is fitted separately:
#
# ```math
# Y_{\text{deaths}} \sim \mathrm{NegBinomial}(\mathrm{CFR}
#     \cdot \mathrm{conv}(\mathrm{onsets},\, f_d)[n],\ k). \tag{18}
# ```
#
# ##### Reported cases
#
# Reported suspected cases are an ascertained fraction of onsets
# convolved with the onset-to-report delay (mean 4.5 d, SD 3.6 d),
# scored per vintage:
#
# ```math
# Y_{\text{cases}} \sim \mathrm{NegBinomial}(p_{\text{DRC}}
#     \cdot \mathrm{conv}(\mathrm{onsets},\, f_{\text{rep}})[n],\ k). \tag{19}
# ```
#
# ##### Confirmed cases
#
# Laboratory-confirmed cases are the test-positivity fraction of
# onsets convolved with the lab-confirmation delay (mean 6.0 d, SD
# 4.0 d), scored per vintage with the same $k$:
#
# ```math
# Y_{\text{confirmed}} \sim \mathrm{NegBinomial}(\pi
#     \cdot \mathrm{conv}(\mathrm{onsets},\, f_{\text{lab}})[n],\ k),
# \qquad
# \pi \sim \mathrm{Beta}(2, 5). \tag{20}
# ```
#
# ##### Deaths among exports
#
# The expected deaths among detected exports reuse the export-onset
# series from equation (16), convolving it with the onset-to-death PMF
# and scaling by the CFR. A Poisson likelihood is used because the
# Uganda death count is small:
#
# ```math
# Y_{\text{exp-deaths}} \sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\mathrm{CFR}
#     \cdot \mathrm{conv}(\mathrm{export\_onsets},\, f_d)[n]). \tag{21}
# ```

# #### Composers
#
# Composers combine building blocks into the full model for each
# analysis. Each observation stream argument may be `missing` to drop
# it, so the same composer structure generates prior- and
# posterior-predictive draws.
#
# The joint composer runs the generating infection process once and
# routes the shared onsets into all five observation submodels. It
# samples a single dispersion $k$ and the two independent ascertainment
# fractions, threading $p_{\text{DRC}}$ to the cases likelihood and
# $p_{\text{Uganda}}$ to the two Uganda-side likelihoods.
#
# We write single-stream composers for each of the five count-based
# streams: exports-only, deaths-only, cases-only, confirmed-only and
# exports-deaths-only.

# ### Model fitting and evaluation
#
# #### Prior predictive check
#
# Before any observation is taken into account, what does the prior
# imply about replicated exports, deaths and reported cases? Draws from

# ### Summary
#
# For the response the question that matters is how many people have
# already been infected: the reported counts capture only part of the
# outbreak, and planning for beds, contacts and vaccine needs depends
# on the true total. The numbers below are our current best estimate of
# that total, computed from the joint posterior and refreshed on every
# build. For each headline number we give the equal-tailed 30%, 60%
# and 90% credible intervals; the same intervals appear in the tables
# below.

# **Why our estimate may differ from McCabe et al.**
# Our estimate fits all streams jointly, samples the nuisance parameters
# that McCabe et al. vary in scenario sweeps, and uses a time-varying
# reproduction number constrained by the sitrep trajectory.
# See [what we do differently](#What-we-do-differently-from-McCabe-et-al.),
# the [comparison with McCabe et al.](#Comparison-with-McCabe-et-al.) and
# the [limitations](#Limitations) for the detail behind this.

# ### Joint model estimates
#
# Our main result is an estimate of the current cumulative case load —
# both reported and unreported cases — at the report date. It is the
# joint posterior over the cumulative case count $C_T$, obtained by
# fitting all five data streams together: the cases exported to Uganda,
# the suspected deaths in the DRC, the reported cases in the DRC (with
# an ascertainment component), the laboratory-confirmed cases in the
# DRC, and the deaths among exported cases in Uganda.
#
# We report the cumulative case count first as a credible-interval
# table and then as a posterior density.
