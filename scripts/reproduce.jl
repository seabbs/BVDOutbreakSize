# Standalone reproduction runner. Fetches the package and re-fits the
# models without a manual `git clone`. Run it straight from the web:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiforecasts/BVDOutbreakSize/main/scripts/reproduce.jl | julia
#
# (Reading a script before piping it to a shell is good practice.)
#
# Outputs are written to `./bvd-output` by default; set
# `BVD_OUTPUT_DIR` to write them elsewhere. Set `BVD_REF` to a release
# tag or branch to reproduce a specific version (defaults to `main`).
#
# The analysis imports several of the package's dependencies directly,
# so it runs against the package's own project. We clone into a
# temporary directory and activate that: it is writable (the analysis
# writes its outputs into the package directory), always fresh, and
# leaves the caller's own Julia environments untouched. Requires `git`
# on the PATH.
